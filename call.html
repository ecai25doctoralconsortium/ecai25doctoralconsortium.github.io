                                    Accepted PhD students will have the opportunity to present their work to peers attending the conference, in the form of oral and/or poster presentations.
                                    The accepted abstracts will be published on the DC website and the list of accepted PhD students will be included in the ECAI-2025 proceedings.

                                            Please write your extended abstract keeping in mind that it will be read by a general AI audience; introduce your research motivation and approach at a level that the general ECAI audience can understand, but also include enough low-level details for experts to understand your unique contributions.
                                            Please use the ECAI 2-column format (link will follow).<!--<a href="https://ecai2025.eu/download/ecai-template.zip">ECAI 2-column format</a>.-->

                                        A detailed letter of recommendation is neither required nor expected.

                                    The selection process will consider the quality of the submitted proposal and the stage of the student's PhD project (ideally when the student has a concrete research proposal and preliminary results but substantial time prior to the completion of the thesis).
                                    Accepted extended abstracts will be shared online on the DC website.
                                    The ECAI-2025 proceedings will include only the list of the PhD students accepted to participate in the DC.
